63f631ebcd2a033703deddac,Tweetienator,16 December 2022,538,1503,6,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"
63f631ebcd2a033703deddad,JumpingCineFile,15 December 2022,217,831,7,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light
63f631ebcd2a033703deddae,Paragon240,16 December 2022,275,706,6,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631ebcd2a033703deddb0,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631ebcd2a033703deddb1,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"
63f631ebcd2a033703deddb2,fraser-simons,29 December 2022,56,136,6,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"
63f631ebcd2a033703deddb3,imseeg,16 December 2022,470,770,4,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie. This movie only has got one gear and it bored the heck out of me!
63f631ebcd2a033703deddb4,namob-43673,16 December 2022,114,215,7,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"
63f631ebcd2a033703deddb5,EvanoOruvan,16 December 2022,319,649,6,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",Most part felt like watching a sequence from National Geographic
63f631ebcd2a033703deddb6,Dory_Darko,14 December 2022,474,910,9,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631ebcd2a033703deddb7,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season.

If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film.

I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced.

If your thought is to wait and stream it, save yourself 3hrs and don't bother (unless you have a great home theatre (even then....)",A movie worth going to see at the cinema

There is Zero plot, nothing happens throughout the entire movie, and as if that isn't really bad of itself, they somehow revived all of the characters from the first movie, on the same mission as in the first movie. The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera. The movie had so much potential, they have created such an exciting universe that could easily be made many more movies of but after a storyline like this one we are done with the avatar franchise.",Extraordinary boring ZzZzZzZ

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631ebcd2a033703deddc2,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"
63f631ebcd2a033703deddc3,cornelia123,19 December 2022,94,174,3,"Seriously, I've just come back from watching the film in the cinema in London and cannot recommend this film. I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631ebcd2a033703deddc4,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631ebcd2a033703deddc9,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631ebcd2a033703deddca,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631ebcd2a033703deddd0,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't. This was beautiful, and an absolute experience in 3D imax."

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",One of the most visually innovative films ever

The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631ebcd2a033703dedddb,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"
63f631ebcd2a033703dedddc,cornelia123,19 December 2022,94,174,3,"Seriously, I've just come back from watching the film in the cinema in London and cannot recommend this film. I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631ebcd2a033703dedddd,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

63f631ebcd2a033703dedde2,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631ebcd2a033703dedde3,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631ebcd2a033703dedde9,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez?

With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631ebcd2a033703deddf4,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand.

Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there.

63f631ebcd2a033703deddfb,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631ebcd2a033703deddfc,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"
63f631ebcd2a033703deddfd,fraser-simons,29 December 2022,56,136,6,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie. This movie only has got one gear and it bored the heck out of me!

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line..

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631ebcd2a033703dede02,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care.

Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631ebcd2a033703dede0d,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James!

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"
63f631ebcd2a033703dede11,JumpingCineFile,15 December 2022,217,831,7,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631ebcd2a033703dede14,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631ebcd2a033703dede15,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631ebcd2a033703dede1b,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of.

This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable.

It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise.

Not in this case .The biggest suprise was how they returned some of the characters from the 1st movie which just fit right in.You either go see it in the cinema (biggest screen possible) or don't bother watching it at all. If your thought is to wait and stream it, save yourself 3hrs and don't bother (unless you have a great home theatre (even then....)",A movie worth going to see at the cinema

There is Zero plot, nothing happens throughout the entire movie, and as if that isn't really bad of itself, they somehow revived all of the characters from the first movie, on the same mission as in the first movie. The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera. The movie had so much potential, they have created such an exciting universe that could easily be made many more movies of but after a storyline like this one we are done with the avatar franchise.",Extraordinary boring ZzZzZzZ

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631ebcd2a033703dede26,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"
63f631ebcd2a033703dede27,cornelia123,19 December 2022,94,174,3,"Seriously, I've just come back from watching the film in the cinema in London and cannot recommend this film. I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631ebcd2a033703dede28,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631ebcd2a033703dede2d,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631ebcd2a033703dede2e,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631ebcd2a033703dede34,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't. This was beautiful, and an absolute experience in 3D imax."

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",One of the most visually innovative films ever

The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631ebcd2a033703dede3f,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"
63f631ebcd2a033703dede40,cornelia123,19 December 2022,94,174,3,"Seriously, I've just come back from watching the film in the cinema in London and cannot recommend this film. I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631ebcd2a033703dede41,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

63f631ebcd2a033703dede46,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631ebcd2a033703dede47,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631ebcd2a033703dede4d,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez?

With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631ebcd2a033703dede58,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand.

Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there.

63f631ebcd2a033703dede5f,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631ebcd2a033703dede60,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"
63f631ebcd2a033703dede61,fraser-simons,29 December 2022,56,136,6,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie. This movie only has got one gear and it bored the heck out of me!

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line..

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631ebcd2a033703dede66,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care.

Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631ebcd2a033703dede71,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James!

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"
63f631ebcd2a033703dede75,JumpingCineFile,15 December 2022,217,831,7,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631ebcd2a033703dede78,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631ebcd2a033703dede79,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631ebcd2a033703dede7f,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of.

This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable.

It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise.

Not in this case .The biggest suprise was how they returned some of the characters from the 1st movie which just fit right in.You either go see it in the cinema (biggest screen possible) or don't bother watching it at all. If your thought is to wait and stream it, save yourself 3hrs and don't bother (unless you have a great home theatre (even then....)",A movie worth going to see at the cinema

There is Zero plot, nothing happens throughout the entire movie, and as if that isn't really bad of itself, they somehow revived all of the characters from the first movie, on the same mission as in the first movie. The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera. The movie had so much potential, they have created such an exciting universe that could easily be made many more movies of but after a storyline like this one we are done with the avatar franchise.",Extraordinary boring ZzZzZzZ

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631ebcd2a033703dede8a,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"
63f631ebcd2a033703dede8b,cornelia123,19 December 2022,94,174,3,"Seriously, I've just come back from watching the film in the cinema in London and cannot recommend this film. I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631ebcd2a033703dede8c,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631ebcd2a033703dede91,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631ebcd2a033703dede92,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631ebcd2a033703dede98,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't. This was beautiful, and an absolute experience in 3D imax."

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",One of the most visually innovative films ever

The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631ebcd2a033703dedea3,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"
63f631ebcd2a033703dedea4,cornelia123,19 December 2022,94,174,3,"Seriously, I've just come back from watching the film in the cinema in London and cannot recommend this film. I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631ebcd2a033703dedea5,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

63f631ebcd2a033703dedeaa,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631ebcd2a033703dedeab,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631ebcd2a033703dedeb1,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers.

With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631ebcd2a033703dedebc,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand.

Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there.

63f631ebcd2a033703dedec3,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dedec4,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"
63f631eccd2a033703dedec5,fraser-simons,29 December 2022,56,136,6,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie. This movie only has got one gear and it bored the heck out of me!

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line..

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631eccd2a033703dedeca,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care.

Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703deded5,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James!

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"
63f631eccd2a033703deded9,JumpingCineFile,15 December 2022,217,831,7,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631eccd2a033703dededc,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dededd,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631eccd2a033703dedee3,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of.

This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable.

It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise.

Not in this case .The biggest suprise was how they returned some of the characters from the 1st movie which just fit right in.You either go see it in the cinema (biggest screen possible) or don't bother watching it at all. If your thought is to wait and stream it, save yourself 3hrs and don't bother (unless you have a great home theatre (even then....)",A movie worth going to see at the cinema

There is Zero plot, nothing happens throughout the entire movie, and as if that isn't really bad of itself, they somehow revived all of the characters from the first movie, on the same mission as in the first movie. The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera. The movie had so much potential, they have created such an exciting universe that could easily be made many more movies of but after a storyline like this one we are done with the avatar franchise.",Extraordinary boring ZzZzZzZ

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703dedeee,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"
63f631eccd2a033703dedeef,cornelia123,19 December 2022,94,174,3,"Seriously, I've just come back from watching the film in the cinema in London and cannot recommend this film. I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631eccd2a033703dedef0,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631eccd2a033703dedef5,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dedef6,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631eccd2a033703dedefc,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't. This was beautiful, and an absolute experience in 3D imax."

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",One of the most visually innovative films ever

The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703dedf07,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces?

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

63f631eccd2a033703dedf0e,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dedf0f,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",Most part felt like watching a sequence from National Geographic

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631eccd2a033703dedf15,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703dedf20,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand.

63f631eccd2a033703dedf27,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dedf28,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631eccd2a033703dedf2e,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season.

If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(

Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James!

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out.

I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631eccd2a033703dedf40,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dedf41,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631eccd2a033703dedf47,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of.

This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable.

It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well.

Would recommended strongly seeing it in 3D, while its mostly a novelty that because in most cases its done cheaply as a gimmic. Not in this case .The biggest suprise was how they returned some of the characters from the 1st movie which just fit right in.You either go see it in the cinema (biggest screen possible) or don't bother watching it at all.

There is Zero plot, nothing happens throughout the entire movie, and as if that isn't really bad of itself, they somehow revived all of the characters from the first movie, on the same mission as in the first movie. The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera. The movie had so much potential, they have created such an exciting universe that could easily be made many more movies of but after a storyline like this one we are done with the avatar franchise.",Extraordinary boring ZzZzZzZ

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703dedf52,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

63f631eccd2a033703dedf59,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dedf5a,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631eccd2a033703dedf60,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling.

Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703dedf6b,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand.

Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there.

63f631eccd2a033703dedf72,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dedf73,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line..

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631eccd2a033703dedf79,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703dedf84,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make.

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand.

Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dedf8c,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"
63f631eccd2a033703dedf8d,fraser-simons,29 December 2022,56,136,6,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie. This movie only has got one gear and it bored the heck out of me!

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line..

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631eccd2a033703dedf92,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season.

If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703dedf9d,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James!

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631eccd2a033703dedf9f,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631eccd2a033703dedfa4,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dedfa5,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631eccd2a033703dedfab,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of.

There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise.

I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",One of the most visually innovative films ever

Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",3 hours of what...

The visuals where beyond fantastic and makes this years other blockbuster CGI look like a joke. Would recommended strongly seeing it in 3D, while its mostly a novelty that because in most cases its done cheaply as a gimmic. Not in this case .The biggest suprise was how they returned some of the characters from the 1st movie which just fit right in.You either go see it in the cinema (biggest screen possible) or don't bother watching it at all.

There is Zero plot, nothing happens throughout the entire movie, and as if that isn't really bad of itself, they somehow revived all of the characters from the first movie, on the same mission as in the first movie. The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera. The movie had so much potential, they have created such an exciting universe that could easily be made many more movies of but after a storyline like this one we are done with the avatar franchise.",Extraordinary boring ZzZzZzZ

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703dedfb6,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"
63f631eccd2a033703dedfb7,cornelia123,19 December 2022,94,174,3,"Seriously, I've just come back from watching the film in the cinema in London and cannot recommend this film. I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631eccd2a033703dedfb8,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631eccd2a033703dedfbd,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dedfbe,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631eccd2a033703dedfc4,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end.

Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",One of the most visually innovative films ever

The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703dedfcf,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang.

They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand.

When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

63f631eccd2a033703dedfd6,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dedfd7,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?!

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631eccd2a033703dedfdd,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez?

With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced.

Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703dedfe8,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make.

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand.

Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dedff0,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"
63f631eccd2a033703dedff1,fraser-simons,29 December 2022,56,136,6,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"
63f631eccd2a033703dedff2,imseeg,16 December 2022,470,770,4,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie. This movie only has got one gear and it bored the heck out of me!

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",Most part felt like watching a sequence from National Geographic

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631eccd2a033703dedff6,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers.

With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced.

Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703dee001,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James!

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631eccd2a033703dee003,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631eccd2a033703dee008,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dee009,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631eccd2a033703dee00f,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of.

Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable.

There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",One of the most visually innovative films ever

Not in this case .The biggest suprise was how they returned some of the characters from the 1st movie which just fit right in.You either go see it in the cinema (biggest screen possible) or don't bother watching it at all.

There is Zero plot, nothing happens throughout the entire movie, and as if that isn't really bad of itself, they somehow revived all of the characters from the first movie, on the same mission as in the first movie. The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera. The movie had so much potential, they have created such an exciting universe that could easily be made many more movies of but after a storyline like this one we are done with the avatar franchise.",Extraordinary boring ZzZzZzZ

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703dee01a,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631eccd2a033703dee01c,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

63f631eccd2a033703dee021,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dee022,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631eccd2a033703dee028,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end.

Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",One of the most visually innovative films ever

The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703dee033,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang.

Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand.

Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there.

63f631eccd2a033703dee03a,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dee03b,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers.

And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie. This movie only has got one gear and it bored the heck out of me!

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",Most part felt like watching a sequence from National Geographic

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631eccd2a033703dee041,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703dee04c,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make.

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631eccd2a033703dee053,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dee054,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"
63f631eccd2a033703dee055,fraser-simons,29 December 2022,56,136,6,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie. This movie only has got one gear and it bored the heck out of me!

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?!

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631eccd2a033703dee05a,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season.

If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film.

I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care.

Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(

Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631eccd2a033703dee06c,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dee06d,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631eccd2a033703dee073,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal.

This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable.

It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise.

If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.",Tiresome

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",One of the most visually innovative films ever

The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703dee07e,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631eccd2a033703dee080,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

63f631eccd2a033703dee085,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dee086,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it.

It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703dee097,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand.

63f631eccd2a033703dee09e,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dee09f,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie. This movie only has got one gear and it bored the heck out of me!

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line..

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631eccd2a033703dee0a5,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced.

Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703dee0b0,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James!

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631eccd2a033703dee0b7,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dee0b8,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"
63f631eccd2a033703dee0b9,fraser-simons,29 December 2022,56,136,6,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie. This movie only has got one gear and it bored the heck out of me!

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line..

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631eccd2a033703dee0be,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise.

Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment.

Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631eccd2a033703dee0d0,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dee0d1,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631eccd2a033703dee0d7,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal.

NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable.

It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.",Tiresome

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",One of the most visually innovative films ever

The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703dee0e2,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

63f631eccd2a033703dee0e9,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dee0ea,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631eccd2a033703dee0f0,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers.

Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703dee0fb,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand.

Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there.

63f631eccd2a033703dee102,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dee103,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned.

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line..

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631eccd2a033703dee109,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care.

Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703dee114,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James!

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631eccd2a033703dee11b,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dee11c,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"
63f631eccd2a033703dee11d,fraser-simons,29 December 2022,56,136,6,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line..

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631eccd2a033703dee122,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of.

NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable.

It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise.

But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703dee12d,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631eccd2a033703dee134,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dee135,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631eccd2a033703dee13b,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of.

Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't. This was beautiful, and an absolute experience in 3D imax."

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.",Tiresome

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",One of the most visually innovative films ever

The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703dee146,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"
63f631eccd2a033703dee147,cornelia123,19 December 2022,94,174,3,"Seriously, I've just come back from watching the film in the cinema in London and cannot recommend this film. I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631eccd2a033703dee148,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

63f631eccd2a033703dee14d,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dee14e,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it.

It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631eccd2a033703dee154,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703dee15f,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest.

63f631eccd2a033703dee166,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty

After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line..

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631eccd2a033703dee16d,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care.

Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(

Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James!

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631eccd2a033703dee17f,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dee180,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631eccd2a033703dee186,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of.

This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable.

It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise.

The movie had so much potential, they have created such an exciting universe that could easily be made many more movies of but after a storyline like this one we are done with the avatar franchise.",Extraordinary boring ZzZzZzZ
63f631eccd2a033703dee190,lovefalloutkindagamer,20 December 2022,97,167,5,"First off, there is no such thing as a perfect movie because the way we all experience movies is different. Subjective. I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eccd2a033703dee191,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"
63f631eccd2a033703dee192,cornelia123,19 December 2022,94,174,3,"Seriously, I've just come back from watching the film in the cinema in London and cannot recommend this film. I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631eccd2a033703dee193,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"
63f631eccd2a033703dee195,JumpingCineFile,15 December 2022,217,831,7,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631eccd2a033703dee198,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eccd2a033703dee199,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631eccd2a033703dee19f,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't. This was beautiful, and an absolute experience in 3D imax."

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",One of the most visually innovative films ever

The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee1aa,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"
63f631edcd2a033703dee1ab,cornelia123,19 December 2022,94,174,3,"Seriously, I've just come back from watching the film in the cinema in London and cannot recommend this film. I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631edcd2a033703dee1ac,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

63f631edcd2a033703dee1b1,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee1b2,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it?

It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631edcd2a033703dee1b8,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers.

Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",One of the most visually innovative films ever

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee1c3,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more.

Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee1cb,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"
63f631edcd2a033703dee1cc,fraser-simons,29 December 2022,56,136,6,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie. This movie only has got one gear and it bored the heck out of me!

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line..

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631edcd2a033703dee1d1,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film.

I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care.

Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(

Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James!

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631edcd2a033703dee1e3,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee1e4,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631edcd2a033703dee1ea,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of.

This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable.

It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise.

Not in this case .The biggest suprise was how they returned some of the characters from the 1st movie which just fit right in.You either go see it in the cinema (biggest screen possible) or don't bother watching it at all. If your thought is to wait and stream it, save yourself 3hrs and don't bother (unless you have a great home theatre (even then....)",A movie worth going to see at the cinema

There is Zero plot, nothing happens throughout the entire movie, and as if that isn't really bad of itself, they somehow revived all of the characters from the first movie, on the same mission as in the first movie. The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera. The movie had so much potential, they have created such an exciting universe that could easily be made many more movies of but after a storyline like this one we are done with the avatar franchise.",Extraordinary boring ZzZzZzZ

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee1f5,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631edcd2a033703dee1f7,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631edcd2a033703dee1fc,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee1fd,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631edcd2a033703dee203,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't. This was beautiful, and an absolute experience in 3D imax."

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",One of the most visually innovative films ever

There is Zero plot, nothing happens throughout the entire movie, and as if that isn't really bad of itself, they somehow revived all of the characters from the first movie, on the same mission as in the first movie. The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee20e,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"
63f631edcd2a033703dee20f,cornelia123,19 December 2022,94,174,3,"Seriously, I've just come back from watching the film in the cinema in London and cannot recommend this film. I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631edcd2a033703dee210,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

63f631edcd2a033703dee215,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee216,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it?

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line..

And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",Most part felt like watching a sequence from National Geographic

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631edcd2a033703dee21c,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee227,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand.

Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there.

63f631edcd2a033703dee22e,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee22f,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line..

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631edcd2a033703dee235,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season.

If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(

Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James!

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631edcd2a033703dee247,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee248,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631edcd2a033703dee24e,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of.

This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable.

It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well.

Would recommended strongly seeing it in 3D, while its mostly a novelty that because in most cases its done cheaply as a gimmic. Not in this case .The biggest suprise was how they returned some of the characters from the 1st movie which just fit right in.You either go see it in the cinema (biggest screen possible) or don't bother watching it at all.

There is Zero plot, nothing happens throughout the entire movie, and as if that isn't really bad of itself, they somehow revived all of the characters from the first movie, on the same mission as in the first movie. The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera. The movie had so much potential, they have created such an exciting universe that could easily be made many more movies of but after a storyline like this one we are done with the avatar franchise.",Extraordinary boring ZzZzZzZ

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee259,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

63f631edcd2a033703dee260,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee261,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631edcd2a033703dee267,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling.

Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee272,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang.

Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand.

Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there.

63f631edcd2a033703dee279,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee27a,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line..

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631edcd2a033703dee280,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee28b,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make.

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand.

Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee293,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"
63f631edcd2a033703dee294,fraser-simons,29 December 2022,56,136,6,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie. This movie only has got one gear and it bored the heck out of me!

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line..

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631edcd2a033703dee299,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season.

If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee2a4,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James!

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631edcd2a033703dee2a6,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631edcd2a033703dee2ab,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee2ac,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it.

It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631edcd2a033703dee2b2,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of.

Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable.

There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well.

I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",One of the most visually innovative films ever

Would recommended strongly seeing it in 3D, while its mostly a novelty that because in most cases its done cheaply as a gimmic. Not in this case .The biggest suprise was how they returned some of the characters from the 1st movie which just fit right in.You either go see it in the cinema (biggest screen possible) or don't bother watching it at all.

There is Zero plot, nothing happens throughout the entire movie, and as if that isn't really bad of itself, they somehow revived all of the characters from the first movie, on the same mission as in the first movie. The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera. The movie had so much potential, they have created such an exciting universe that could easily be made many more movies of but after a storyline like this one we are done with the avatar franchise.",Extraordinary boring ZzZzZzZ

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee2bd,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631edcd2a033703dee2bf,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

63f631edcd2a033703dee2c4,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee2c5,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631edcd2a033703dee2cb,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end.

Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",One of the most visually innovative films ever

The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee2d6,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces?

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand.

Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

63f631edcd2a033703dee2dd,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee2de,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",Most part felt like watching a sequence from National Geographic

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631edcd2a033703dee2e4,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers.

For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee2ef,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631edcd2a033703dee2f6,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee2f7,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"
63f631edcd2a033703dee2f8,fraser-simons,29 December 2022,56,136,6,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie. This movie only has got one gear and it bored the heck out of me!

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",Most part felt like watching a sequence from National Geographic

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631edcd2a033703dee2fd,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season.

If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film.

I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee308,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631edcd2a033703dee30a,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631edcd2a033703dee30f,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee310,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631edcd2a033703dee316,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of.

This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable.

It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well.

One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.",Tiresome

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",One of the most visually innovative films ever

Not in this case .The biggest suprise was how they returned some of the characters from the 1st movie which just fit right in.You either go see it in the cinema (biggest screen possible) or don't bother watching it at all.

The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee321,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

63f631edcd2a033703dee328,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee329,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631edcd2a033703dee32f,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers.

Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee33a,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand.

Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there.

63f631edcd2a033703dee341,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee342,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie. This movie only has got one gear and it bored the heck out of me!

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?!

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631edcd2a033703dee348,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced.

Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee353,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make.

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631edcd2a033703dee35a,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee35b,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"
63f631edcd2a033703dee35c,fraser-simons,29 December 2022,56,136,6,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie. This movie only has got one gear and it bored the heck out of me!

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline..""..

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631edcd2a033703dee361,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season.

If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(

Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631edcd2a033703dee373,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee374,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631edcd2a033703dee37a,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of.

This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable.

It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise.

If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.",Tiresome

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",One of the most visually innovative films ever

The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee385,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631edcd2a033703dee387,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

63f631edcd2a033703dee38c,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee38d,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it.

It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee39e,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest.

63f631edcd2a033703dee3a5,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee3a6,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie. This movie only has got one gear and it bored the heck out of me!

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line..

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631edcd2a033703dee3ac,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care.

Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee3b7,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James!

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631edcd2a033703dee3be,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee3bf,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"
63f631edcd2a033703dee3c0,fraser-simons,29 December 2022,56,136,6,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie. This movie only has got one gear and it bored the heck out of me!

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline..""..

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631edcd2a033703dee3c5,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal.

NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise.

Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment.

Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631edcd2a033703dee3d7,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee3d8,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631edcd2a033703dee3de,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal.

NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable.

It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.",Tiresome

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",One of the most visually innovative films ever

The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee3e9,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"
63f631edcd2a033703dee3ea,cornelia123,19 December 2022,94,174,3,"Seriously, I've just come back from watching the film in the cinema in London and cannot recommend this film. I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631edcd2a033703dee3eb,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

63f631edcd2a033703dee3f0,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee3f1,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631edcd2a033703dee3f7,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end.

Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee402,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand.

Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there.

63f631edcd2a033703dee409,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee40a,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned.

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line..

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631edcd2a033703dee410,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care.

Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee41b,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James!

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631edcd2a033703dee422,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee423,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"
63f631edcd2a033703dee424,fraser-simons,29 December 2022,56,136,6,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line..

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631edcd2a033703dee429,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of.

NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable.

It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise.

But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee434,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631edcd2a033703dee43b,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee43c,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631edcd2a033703dee442,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of.

Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't. This was beautiful, and an absolute experience in 3D imax."

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.",Tiresome

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",One of the most visually innovative films ever

The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee44d,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"
63f631edcd2a033703dee44e,cornelia123,19 December 2022,94,174,3,"Seriously, I've just come back from watching the film in the cinema in London and cannot recommend this film. I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631edcd2a033703dee44f,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

63f631edcd2a033703dee454,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee455,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it.

It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631edcd2a033703dee45b,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee466,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again.

63f631edcd2a033703dee46d,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty

After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line..

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631edcd2a033703dee474,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care.

Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(

Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James!

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631edcd2a033703dee486,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee487,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631edcd2a033703dee48d,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of.

This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable.

It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise.

The movie had so much potential, they have created such an exciting universe that could easily be made many more movies of but after a storyline like this one we are done with the avatar franchise.",Extraordinary boring ZzZzZzZ
63f631edcd2a033703dee497,lovefalloutkindagamer,20 December 2022,97,167,5,"First off, there is no such thing as a perfect movie because the way we all experience movies is different. Subjective. I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee498,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"
63f631edcd2a033703dee499,cornelia123,19 December 2022,94,174,3,"Seriously, I've just come back from watching the film in the cinema in London and cannot recommend this film. I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631edcd2a033703dee49a,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"
63f631edcd2a033703dee49c,JumpingCineFile,15 December 2022,217,831,7,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631edcd2a033703dee49f,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee4a0,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631edcd2a033703dee4a6,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't. This was beautiful, and an absolute experience in 3D imax."

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",One of the most visually innovative films ever

The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee4b1,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"
63f631edcd2a033703dee4b2,cornelia123,19 December 2022,94,174,3,"Seriously, I've just come back from watching the film in the cinema in London and cannot recommend this film. I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631edcd2a033703dee4b3,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

63f631edcd2a033703dee4b8,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee4b9,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it?

That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631edcd2a033703dee4bf,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",One of the most visually innovative films ever

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631edcd2a033703dee4ca,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again.

Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631edcd2a033703dee4d2,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"
63f631edcd2a033703dee4d3,fraser-simons,29 December 2022,56,136,6,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie. This movie only has got one gear and it bored the heck out of me!

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line..

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631edcd2a033703dee4d8,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care.

Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(

Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James!

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631eecd2a033703dee4ea,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eecd2a033703dee4eb,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631eecd2a033703dee4f1,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of.

NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable.

It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise.

Not in this case .The biggest suprise was how they returned some of the characters from the 1st movie which just fit right in.You either go see it in the cinema (biggest screen possible) or don't bother watching it at all. If your thought is to wait and stream it, save yourself 3hrs and don't bother (unless you have a great home theatre (even then....)",A movie worth going to see at the cinema

There is Zero plot, nothing happens throughout the entire movie, and as if that isn't really bad of itself, they somehow revived all of the characters from the first movie, on the same mission as in the first movie. The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera. The movie had so much potential, they have created such an exciting universe that could easily be made many more movies of but after a storyline like this one we are done with the avatar franchise.",Extraordinary boring ZzZzZzZ

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eecd2a033703dee4fc,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631eecd2a033703dee4fe,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631eecd2a033703dee503,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eecd2a033703dee504,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631eecd2a033703dee50a,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't. This was beautiful, and an absolute experience in 3D imax."

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",One of the most visually innovative films ever

There is Zero plot, nothing happens throughout the entire movie, and as if that isn't really bad of itself, they somehow revived all of the characters from the first movie, on the same mission as in the first movie. The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eecd2a033703dee515,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"
63f631eecd2a033703dee516,cornelia123,19 December 2022,94,174,3,"Seriously, I've just come back from watching the film in the cinema in London and cannot recommend this film. I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631eecd2a033703dee517,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

63f631eecd2a033703dee51c,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eecd2a033703dee51d,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it?

It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line..

And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",Most part felt like watching a sequence from National Geographic

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631eecd2a033703dee523,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez?

Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced.

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eecd2a033703dee52e,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make.

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems.

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside.

Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand.

Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there.

63f631eecd2a033703dee535,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eecd2a033703dee536,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",Pretty visuals dont make a good movie.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",Damn James Cameron...
63f631eecd2a033703dee53c,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season.

If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(

Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James!

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time.

I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story."

Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
63f631eecd2a033703dee54e,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eecd2a033703dee54f,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","James Cameron's triumphant return"

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is"

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631eecd2a033703dee555,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",Visually stunning but very weak characters and story

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of.

This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable.

It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well.

Would recommended strongly seeing it in 3D, while its mostly a novelty that because in most cases its done cheaply as a gimmic. Not in this case .The biggest suprise was how they returned some of the characters from the 1st movie which just fit right in.You either go see it in the cinema (biggest screen possible) or don't bother watching it at all.

There is Zero plot, nothing happens throughout the entire movie, and as if that isn't really bad of itself, they somehow revived all of the characters from the first movie, on the same mission as in the first movie. The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera. The movie had so much potential, they have created such an exciting universe that could easily be made many more movies of but after a storyline like this one we are done with the avatar franchise.",Extraordinary boring ZzZzZzZ

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eecd2a033703dee560,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"

Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","Visuals Top, Movie Not"

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",Visually stunning and action packed but story is light

Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

63f631eecd2a033703dee567,alfredvankuik,15 December 2022,585,1905,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",Empty beauty
63f631eecd2a033703dee568,Jeremy_Urquhart,14 December 2022,540,1041,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche"

He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

63f631eecd2a033703dee56e,Sam56800,16 December 2022,214,456,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling.

This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",Story and especially the dialogue is awful.

For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.","During Cameron's VFX gloating...he forgot to throw in a story.."

We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","I Don't care. I just don't. This was beautiful, and an absolute experience in 3D imax."

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",How does a script get ignored for 13 years?

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.",Tiresome
63f631eecd2a033703dee574,louis1011,18 December 2022,210,362,9,"This film is visually stunning. It simply has to be seen on the biggest screen possible in 3d. That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",One of the most visually innovative films ever

Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",3 hours of what...

The visuals where beyond fantastic and makes this years other blockbuster CGI look like a joke. Would recommended strongly seeing it in 3D, while its mostly a novelty that because in most cases its done cheaply as a gimmic. Not in this case .The biggest suprise was how they returned some of the characters from the 1st movie which just fit right in.You either go see it in the cinema (biggest screen possible) or don't bother watching it at all.

There is Zero plot, nothing happens throughout the entire movie, and as if that isn't really bad of itself, they somehow revived all of the characters from the first movie, on the same mission as in the first movie. The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera. The movie had so much potential, they have created such an exciting universe that could easily be made many more movies of but after a storyline like this one we are done with the avatar franchise.",Extraordinary boring ZzZzZzZ

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(
63f631eecd2a033703dee579,OJT,14 December 2022,264,330,5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun"
63f631eecd2a033703dee57a,cornelia123,19 December 2022,94,174,3,"Seriously, I've just come back from watching the film in the cinema in London and cannot recommend this film. I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage"
63f631eecd2a033703dee57b,AdrenalinDragon,16 December 2022,123,170,6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","More Avatar, More Water, More Average"
